# Akeem's Eliza Chatbot

The project is supposed to be me creating a version of the Eliza Chatbot and then i must deploy it to Github Pages. Eliza chatbot worked by using patterns matching to create an illusion of understanding.

### Features
Client side must use HTML, CSS and JavaScript

No external libraries or APIs used

Simple UI

### How it works
So the eliza chatbot worked by simulated conversation by using a pattern matching and substitution methodology that gave users an illusion of understanding on the part of the program, but had no representation that could be considered really understanding what was being said by either party.

### Project Structure
index.html: This will be the structure of the webpage

style.css: This contains the design and style of the UI

Eliza.js: This will be where we implement the Eliza Chatbot logic

## How to run
Clone the repo and then just open the index.html in the browser
